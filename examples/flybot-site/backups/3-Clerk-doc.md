A small Clojure tool converts a Clojure source file into a Markdown file.

Living on Github/Gitlab, a proper README is very important, most users judge your work just by browsing it. Normally, you have code inside it, try to attract your potential users' attention. However, the code embedded not always working, especially if you update the project frequently.

We programmers always want to write code first, making sure it runs. Clerk-doc is an attempt that invites you just writing code, and it turns your code into a hopefully decent document.

Another experimental feature I put inside is AI (ChatGPT) improving, this tool can feed your document to it and hope AI improves it. Please use it cautiously, because AI sometimes (always?) surprises you.
