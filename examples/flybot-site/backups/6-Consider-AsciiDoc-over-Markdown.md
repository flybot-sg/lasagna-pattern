[AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/) is another markup language for text formatting other than widely used Markdown (as this site currently uses).

## Why?

- AsciiDoc has a more consistent grammer, in my opinion.
- It has more standard features than Markdown. Like tables, sidebars, etc.

## Why not?

- People donot widely know it.
- Many tools do not support it.

## Decision?

Pending. I will try it writing documentation for some projects.
